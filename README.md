Oracle Integration Cloud (OIC) – Hands-On Practice Repository
Introduction

This repository captures my hands-on learning journey with Oracle Integration Cloud (OIC), based on the UnoGeeks OIC training curriculum. It focuses on practical implementation, real integration scenarios, and design understanding rather than theoretical explanations alone.

The repository serves as a learning log, technical reference, and portfolio-ready project showcase, demonstrating how different OIC integration patterns are designed, built, tested, and analyzed.

Purpose of This Repository

To practice and implement Oracle Integration Cloud concepts end to end

To maintain structured notes and reusable artifacts for revision

To document real integration flows with testing observations

To showcase practical OIC experience for professional evaluation

Key Areas Covered

Oracle Integration Cloud fundamentals and architecture

Integration design patterns and best practices

Adapter-based connectivity and orchestration

End-to-end integration implementation and testing

Monitoring, fault handling, and troubleshooting

Integration Types Implemented

App-Driven Integrations
Synchronous request–response integrations with tracking and fault handling.

Scheduled Integrations
Time-based integrations using file server, stage file actions, and batch processing.

Real-Time Integrations
Near real-time and asynchronous patterns with performance considerations.

SaaS-to-SaaS Integrations
End-to-end orchestration between SaaS applications using OIC adapters.
